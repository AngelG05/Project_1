          What is wrong with Indian Education system?

        <div class="main_content">
          Scored 92% in 10th class.
          <br>
          She decided to study Psychology.
          <br>
          Everyone around her called her dumb.
          <br><br>
          They said she was going to regret it. When She went to take admission for 11th class, even teachers advised her to enroll in science or commerce. They told her that there was no scope in this field and you are too good to study humanity.
          <br><br>
          She ignored everyone and pursued her dream.
          <br><br>
          With her sheer brilliance, she became the school topper in the 12th board exam and got 100/100 in the subject of Psychology.
          <br><br>
          No one expected that a student from humanity could get the first rank in the school.
          <br>
          And again, this time no one praised her.
          <br><br>
          Why?
          <br><br>
          ”Humanity hai. top karna aasan tha”, they all said.(It's easy to get the top rank in humanity major)
          <br><br>
          Because of her academic excellence, she got into a really great college at Delhi University to study psychology and understand human behavior.
          <br><br>
          She did exceptionally well throughout her academic career. And finally decided to pursue research in the field of psychology. She went to IIT Delhi, and she was the youngest Ph.D. scholar in her group.
          <br><br>
          Even this time her friends & relatives told her: ”Jhooth bol rahi hai ke iska IIT me hua, IIT to technical college hota hai.”(She's lying that she's studying in IIT. It's a technical college only)
          <br><br>
          — She did a project with UNESCO
          <br>
          — Selected for the International Young Research Scholar program.
          <br>
          — She is currently doing another project with WHO and the United Nation.
          <br><br>
          But it doesn't matter, does it?
          <br><br>
          She didn't do Btech after all.
          <br><br>
          And this is what wrong with our education system.
          <br><br>
          “Our obsession with Btech and MBBS”
          <br><br>
          Anyways, meet Kirti Tyagi .
          <br><br>
          Let's give her all the praise she deserves.
          <br><br>
          Let's respect every field of study and not only Btech or MBBS.
